#summary Welcome to Pats Flickr extension!
#labels Featured

An extension for the Google Chrome browser that aims to extend the functionality of [http://www.flickr.com Flickr].

The Google Extension page for Patr is <a href="https://chrome.google.com/extensions/detail/iplbmjolljikncjboeofgmjoaacheemi">located here</a>.

=Introduction=
My goal is to implement features that will best take advantage of features on Flickr that would make the experience even better!

At the moment I have currently implemented these fantastic features!
  * [Introduction#Lightbox Lightbox (image on a dark background)]
  * [Introduction#EXIF_Data EXIF Data] directly on photo page under "Additional Information
  * [Introduction#Sizes All Sizes Links] for direct access to all available image sizes
  * [Introduction#Move_Additional_Information Move Additional Information] higher on the page
  * [Introduction#Flic.kr_short_URLs Flic.kr Short URLs]
  * [Introduction#Big_Group_Previews Big Group Previews] instead of wimpy, small thumbnails
  * [Introduction#Eye_Candy Eye Candy] enhancements to the look and feel of Flickr

Hopefully to come before too long:
  * Multiple group select and submits
  * Better lightbox functionality
  * Set/Group browsing enhancements
  * and more...

== Lightbox ==

Lightbox can be toggled on/off by using either the keyboard (L), or by clicking on a photo on it's photo page.  Lightbox has been updated since v0.1.5 to also work for photos marked private, but still viewable by you!

== EXIF Data ==
_*Finally*_ added EXIF data on the photo page.  It's currently located under "Additional Information" (near the link to get to the exif data originally).  This works well with Move "Additional Information"...

== Sizes ==
Links to all of the available sizes of a photo are now embedded just below the upload information on a photo page.

== Move Additional Information ==
Now you can opt to move the "Additional Information" for a photo further up the right sidebar of the to be more prominent when viewing a photo.  No longer will you have to scroll through a large list of set/pools that the photo also belongs in to see this information!

== Flic.kr short URLs ==
Shortened Flic.kr URLs are now available directly in the "Additional Information" list.  You can just right-click on the URL and copy the address for pasting into other services like Twitter, or to email or IM.  You can see the Flic.kr link in the image above for "Move 'Additional Information'".

== Big Group Previews ==
There is now an option to see a much larger sized preview of images in groups and your contacts.  The old version had smaller images, this one uses the medium sized images instead.

== Eye Candy ==
Various little tweaks to the UI of Flickr. These will be made optional shortly.
