#summary Welcome to Pats Flickr extension!
#labels Featured

An extension for the Google Chrome browser that aims to extend the functionality of [http://www.flickr.com Flickr].

=Introduction=
My goal is to implement features that will best take advantage of features on Flickr that would make the experience even better!

At the moment this is just a lightbox extension, but more features are planned.

  * Multiple group select and submits
  * Better lightbox functionality
  * Set/Group browsing enhancements
  * and more...

== Lightbox ==

Lightbox can be toggled on/off by using either the keyboard (L), or by clicking on a photo on it's photo page.  Lightbox has been updated since v0.1.5 to also work for photos marked private, but still viewable by you!

== Sizes ==
Links to all of the available sizes of a photo are now embedded just below the upload information on a photo page.
