kj#summary Welcome to Pats Flickr extension!

= Patr - Pats Flickr extension =

Implementing various tweaks to add to the functionality and usefulness of Flickr.


= Lightbox =

At the moment all I have implemented is a lightbox function.  This will simply display a larger view of the current image on a darkened background (by using the "L" key).

I have now incorporated some webkit css transition goodness to the lightbox.

Lightbox can be triggered using either the "L" key on the keyboard, or clicking on the photo in it's photo page.

= Sizes =

Added direct links to each of the available sizes for a photo.
