The extension should be fairly self-explanatory!

**Lightbox** can be activated using either the "L" key on the keyboard, or by clicking on a photo on its photo page.

**All Sizes** will automatically appear under the upload information for any photo.

**Flic.kr** short links will be under "Additional Information" for a photo on the bottom right.

In discussions/comments, any previous posts by people will show the ability to automatically **respond by their name** (or in `[b]`old), or **by icon** (or in a 1/2 size).

There is an **options** page to customize all of these additions as well!
