# Introduction #

Where we would like to go in the future, and improvements that are to be made.

## Ideas ##

  * I am thinking of adding the ability to click on any username (or an icon next to the name), and to allow a popup/popover that shows the last n number of photos from that person!

  * ~~Send to multiple groups - this one has been on my todo list from day one.  Desperately need a better way to send to multiple groups at once (better than default and organizr imo).~~

  * Customizable background/text colors for the entire page.

  * Customized "from your contacts" page, arranged by contact, as stacks of their latest photos.

  * Tag auto-completion to auto complete your most popoular tags.

  * ~~Add larger preview size images in group pools.~~

  * Drag and drop uploader in the browser.  Just drag an image onto the browser window with flickr running, and we can upload the photo to the persons photostream in the background, then alert them when done to modify stuff.

  * Stats - use webSQL and start logging peoples stats from the previous day in the background.  This way they can view their all-time stats as needed.
